/*!
  @brief Adafruit_NeoPXL8 is a subclass of Adafruit_NeoPixel containing
         buffers for DMA-formatted 8-way concurrent output. Once a transfer
         is initiated, the original NeoPixel data can then be modified for
         the next frame while the transfer operates in the background.

    @brief  Change the NeoPixel end-of-data latch period. Here be dragons.

                periods. For example, early WS2812 pixels recommend a 50 uS
                latch, late-model WS2812Bs suggest 300 (the default value).
                A shorter latch may allow very slightly faster refresh rates
                (a few percent at best -- strand length is a much bigger
                influence). Check datasheet for your specific pixels to get
                a recommended figure, then you can try empirically dialing
                down from there, with the understanding that this change may
                not work with other pixels. What you ABSOLUTELY MUST NOT DO
                is rely on the bare minimum value that works on your bench,
                because addressable LEDs are affected by environmental
                factors like temperature; an installation relying on a bare-
                minimum figure WILL fail when relocated, e.g. Burning Man.

             then green, and least significant byte is blue.
    @note    Unlike the NeoPixel library, brightness scaling is not a

             orders are covered by the library and do not need to be handled
